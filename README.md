# PowerBI Sample COVID-19 Report
## Introduction
I have created this sample PowerBI report to apply my skills in visualising data as well as presentation on the publicly available dataset [COVID-19 Global Statistics](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harshitstark/covid-19-global-statistics-dataset "COVID-19 Global Statistics").
## Structure
The report is presented in three pages:
+ Introduction

  This section summarises the content of the report, its audience and its ability to guide decision making.
+ General Overview

  Includes numerical headlines on critical information, including the number of total cases, deaths recoveries and tests worldwide as well as total infected per country.
+ Detailed Analysis

  Interactive searching features and country-specific examination. Any trend can be visualised automatically through a built-in PowerBI phrasing system.
## Accessibility
This report was simple, compact and quite informative. It uses buttons to shift between pages and between visuals on the same page. Interactive visuals also make unfound or uncovered trends available during presentation without using too much space.
